  "about": "Hi there! I'm Ryan, a software developer living in Boston, MA. After graduating Boston College with degrees in finance and computer science, I've spent time working on everything from databases to UI/UX, and have grown truly passionate about full stack engineering. In addition to my technical skills, I bring strengths as a clear communicator and creative thinker. Not only in work but also in life, I enjoy doing things outside of my comfort zone and solving new challenges. Whether it's learning how to ski or building my first web application, I'm always eager to dive in head first. Curious to know more? Check out some of my experiences and accomplishments below. Psst... this page is responsive in case you need to go mobile!"
